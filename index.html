        <p>This is a fork of StreamControl to make it more suited for SC2 tournaments and other games, it will still retain the fighting game support of the original release.</p>

<p>StreamControl writes an XML file for use with XSplit and it's ability to use SWF files to display information. It has support for many purposes but mostly gaming.</p>

<p>If you have no idea how to edit the flash files it is also possible to use StreamControl with the default XSplit title plugins. Just point it at the streamcontrol.xml file in your XSplit directory and you'll be good to go.</p>

<p>Rough how-to:
1. Place StreamControl.exe in it's own directory (shouldn't actually matter where)
2. Run it. It should autodetect your XSplit installation if you installed XSplit to the default location. If not, please click configure and set it there.
3. Load XSplit and set up the scene. Add the SWF overlays you require.
4. Done.</p>
